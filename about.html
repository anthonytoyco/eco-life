      <h2>The Goal of Eco-Life</h2>
      <p>Overall, our goal for the app is to create a platform where users can have fun while inspiring and educating
        them on actively reducing their environmental impact.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="about-audience">
      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>We created Eco-Life with students (teenagers and young adults) in mind. Their main needs include guidance and
        education on having an eco-friendly lifestyle, motivation to stay consistent, a sense of community, and active
        engagement. Incorporating gamification elements into Eco-life allows it to keep the students engaged in
        sustainable living, while providing a competitive community to continuously motivate them to live sustainably.
